# üîÑ Refresh Token Analysis & Fixes

## üö® Issues Identified

After scanning the entire project, I found several critical issues with the refresh token implementation that were preventing automatic token refresh when access tokens expired.

### **Backend Issues:**

1. **Cookie Security Setting**: 
   - `secure=True` was set for cookies, which only works over HTTPS
   - In development (HTTP), cookies were not being sent
   - **Fixed**: Changed to `secure=False` for development

2. **Cookie Path Limitation**: 
   - Refresh token cookie was set with `path="/api/v1/refresh"`
   - This limited the cookie to only that specific endpoint
   - **Fixed**: Changed to `path="/"` to make it available for all paths

3. **Cookie SameSite Setting**: 
   - `samesite="strict"` was too restrictive
   - **Fixed**: Changed to `samesite="lax"` for better compatibility

4. **Missing Database Storage**: 
   - New refresh tokens weren't being stored in database during refresh
   - Old tokens weren't being deleted
   - **Fixed**: Added proper database operations in `refresh_access_token()`

### **Frontend Issues:**

1. **Inconsistent Token Storage**: 
   - Frontend stored `refresh_token` in localStorage during login
   - Backend expected it in HttpOnly cookie
   - **Fixed**: Removed localStorage storage of refresh tokens

2. **Missing Error Handling**: 
   - Limited error logging for debugging
   - **Fixed**: Added detailed console logging

## üîß Fixes Applied

### **Backend Fixes (`app/api/routes.py`):**

```python
# Login endpoint - Fixed cookie settings
response.set_cookie(
    key="refresh_token",
    value=result["refresh_token"],
    httponly=True,
    secure=False,  # Changed from True to False for development
    samesite="lax",  # Changed from "strict" to "lax"
    max_age=7 * 24 * 3600,
    path="/",  # Changed from "/api/v1/refresh" to "/"
)

# Refresh endpoint - Same cookie settings
response.set_cookie(
    key="refresh_token",
    value=result["refresh_token"],
    httponly=True,
    secure=False,
    samesite="lax",
    max_age=7 * 24 * 3600,
    path="/",
)

# Logout endpoint - Fixed cookie deletion
response.delete_cookie(key="refresh_token", path="/")
```

### **Backend Service Fixes (`app/core/services.py`):**

```python
async def refresh_access_token(self, refresh_token: str) -> dict:
    # ... existing verification code ...
    
    # Create new tokens
    new_access_token = self._create_access_token(username, user.is_admin)
    new_refresh_token = self._create_refresh_token(username, user.is_admin)

    # Store new refresh token and delete old one
    await self.refresh_token_repository.delete_by_token(refresh_token)
    await self.refresh_token_repository.create(
        token=new_refresh_token,
        username=username,
        expires_at=datetime.now(timezone.utc)
        + timedelta(days=self.refresh_token_expire_days),
    )
    
    return {
        "access_token": new_access_token,
        "refresh_token": new_refresh_token,
        # ... rest of response
    }
```

### **Frontend Fixes (`frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`):**

```javascript
// Removed refresh_token storage from localStorage
const data = await res.json();
localStorage.setItem("access_token", data.access_token);
// Remove refresh_token storage since it's now handled by HttpOnly cookies
localStorage.setItem("username", data.username);
```

### **Frontend Fixes (`frontend/src/utils/fetchWithAuth.js`):**

```javascript
export default async function fetchWithAuth(url, options = {}, navigate) {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  if (res.status === 401 || res.status === 403) {
    console.log("Access token expired, attempting to refresh...");
    
    const refreshRes = await fetch("/api/v1/refresh", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      credentials: "include",
    });
    
    if (refreshRes.ok) {
      const data = await refreshRes.json();
      console.log("Token refresh successful");
      localStorage.setItem("access_token", data.access_token);
      // ... retry original request
    } else {
      console.log("Token refresh failed, redirecting to login");
      // ... cleanup and redirect
    }
  }
  
  return res;
}
```

## üß™ Testing

Created `test_refresh_token.py` to verify the fixes work:

```bash
python test_refresh_token.py
```

This test:
1. Registers a test user
2. Logs in to get tokens
3. Tests accessing protected endpoints
4. Tests refresh token functionality
5. Verifies new tokens work

## üîç How It Works Now

### **Login Flow:**
1. User logs in with username/password
2. Backend creates access token (30 min) and refresh token (7 days)
3. Access token returned in response body
4. Refresh token stored in HttpOnly cookie
5. Frontend stores access token in localStorage

### **Token Refresh Flow:**
1. Frontend makes API request with access token
2. If server returns 401/403 (token expired)
3. Frontend automatically calls `/api/v1/refresh` with cookie
4. Backend validates refresh token from cookie
5. Backend creates new access token and refresh token
6. New tokens returned, old refresh token deleted from database
7. Frontend retries original request with new access token

### **Security Features:**
- Refresh tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies (not accessible via JavaScript)
- Refresh tokens stored in database with expiration
- Old refresh tokens deleted when new ones issued
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens

## üöÄ Expected Behavior

After these fixes:

1. **Home Page Access**: When access token expires, automatic refresh should work
2. **Post Creation**: When creating posts with expired token, automatic refresh should work
3. **All API Calls**: Any 401/403 response should trigger automatic token refresh
4. **Seamless Experience**: Users shouldn't see authentication errors unless refresh token is also expired

## üîß Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. **HTTPS Required**: Set `secure=True` in cookie settings
2. **Domain Configuration**: Configure proper domain settings for cookies
3. **Token Cleanup**: Implement scheduled cleanup of expired refresh tokens
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging to track refresh token usage and failures

## üìù Summary

The main issues were:
1. **Cookie configuration** preventing cookies from being sent in development
2. **Missing database operations** for refresh token rotation
3. **Inconsistent token storage** between frontend and backend

All issues have been fixed and the refresh token functionality should now work correctly when access tokens expire.
